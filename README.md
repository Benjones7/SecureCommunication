SECURE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL USING AES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
The objective of this project was to design and implement a secure communication channel using encryption algorithms. I chose to use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and my work was done using Python. This project involved creating both server and client applications that could exchange encrypted messages securely over a network.

Running the Application

•	Clone the repository:
In your terminal run “git clone https://github.com/Benjones7/SecureCommunication.git”.
•	Navigate to the project directory:
Locate the project directory “SecureCommunication” and navigate to it using the command
“cd SecureCommunication”
•	Start the server:
Run command “python3 server_gui.py” and start server.
•	Start the client:
In a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the project directory again and run command “python3 client_gui.py”
•	Send messages.
From the client, write the message and send. You will it automatically gets encrypted and on the server display, you’ll get the decrypted message.
